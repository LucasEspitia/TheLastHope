## Objective
Have you ever played Pacman? Well, this in theory is very similar but in a more interesting way, now you are chased by ZOMBIESS!!!, try to save yourself and collect as many points as possible.
The game has several difficulties, after passing the first stages you'll see...

Enjoy and don't be scared by the atmosphere of the game. 

# Stop there... 
I wanted to add more features like collecting guns, grenades and so on, but I have left it aside. If you see this repo and want to complete it, make me a contributor, it would be much appreciated. :)

The movement of the zombies is determined by an approximation algorithm, Pacman style. Use it very responsibly.
